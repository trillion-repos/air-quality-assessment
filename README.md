# Air Quality Assessment Tool

Create a simple Air Quality Assessment Tool using the technology of your choice ( java, python, nodejs, or even a web front end framework) that utilizes [Open AQ Platform API](https://docs.openaq.org).  It will have the ability to compare the Air Quality of two cities.  

The tool must:

* Allow the user to input two cities
* Display the air quality of the corresponding cities, allowing the user to compare the two
* Gracefully handle any API or user errors
* Tool should be easily used by the general public
